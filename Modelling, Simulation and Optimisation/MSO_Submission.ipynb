The first sample of signalling blocks which has known travelling times (where the train is expected to idle along) and the other one with known distance (In this train will go for max speed).<br/> The first type of signalling blocks are placed within London Euston to London Old Oak and Birmingham Interchange to Birmingham Curzon Street. This information is already provided in the topic and hence, no adjustments are made here. The second kind of signalling blocks is located within the known distance of 145kms between London Old Oak and Birmingham Interchange stations. The number of blocks between these stations are unknown and are not mentioned in the question. Hence, the effort is made to find the optimum number of blocks between London Old Oak and Birmingham Interchange.<br/> \n",
